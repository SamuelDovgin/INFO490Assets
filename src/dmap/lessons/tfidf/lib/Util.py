'''
the following regular expression tokenize's the text: 
['A-Za-z0-9]+-?['A-Za-z0-9]+ 
Note that this regular expression will
skip single letter words (and numbers)
not match double hyphenated words (Aunt--Poly) (it will be two matches)
keep single hyphenated words (e.g. iron-will)
include the apostrophe in all of its possible uses. 
Make sure you understand why the given regular expression 
has those limitations.  
how to treat: you-didâ€”I-didn't

normalize the tokens

strip off any leading and trailing apostrophes
keep the internal ones
do NOT change the case of the word
you will need to use the powerful string methods you learned in the bootcamp
